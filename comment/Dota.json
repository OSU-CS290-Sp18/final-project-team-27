That is both a good thing and a bad one.Valve is pushing the envelop with lots of new ideas implemented in the past couple years. I for one liked the classical feel of the frozen throne era. Had problems adapting to DotA2 but once It began to click, I saw it for its whole majesty.Thank god the changes made took a turn they were great and needed. It embraced new players while keeping the old ones. "
