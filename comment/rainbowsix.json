This game is very intense, strategic, and good for the memes. But... there is a lot of toxicicty in the servers. From team kills, to throwing, to voting to kick just for your username. I wouldn't say that takes away from the game though, i would just suggest you squad up, and PTFO. Loads of fun, highly recommended!"
